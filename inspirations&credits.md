## History Books
- The New Roman Empire: A History of Byzantium by Anthony Kaldellis - The New standard more up to date than previous books
- History of Byzantium by John Julius Norwich - Read these books multiple times over the 2000s and was the main cause of my fascination with the Medieval Roman Empire.
