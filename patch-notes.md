## Estate privileges
- Added new estate privilege: Boiárski Voĭski  
  The traditional levy of the Bulgarian boyars forms the backbone of our armies. These noble households maintain armed retainers and provide large contingents of horsemen in times of war. By reaffirming their martial rights and obligations, we strengthen our military capacity—though at the cost of granting the boyars greater influence within the realm.
