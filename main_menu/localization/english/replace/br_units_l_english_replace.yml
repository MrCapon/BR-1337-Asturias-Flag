 a_byzantine_cataphracts_desc: "A powerful body of heavily armored knights, the Katáphraktoi make up the elite of our cavalry units. Armed with a short lance named 'kontos' and covered in scale armor, these troops strike fear at the heart of our enemies. A whirlwind of steel in the form of an unstoppable wave of horsemen delivers the killing blow to all those who seek to trample our people."
