 elysium.1.title: "The Birth of Elysium"
 elysium.1.desc: "For generations, our scattered settlements survived as fragments of an exile—Latin and Greek, Pantheonic and Christian, divided by creed and custom. Yet the old dream endured: that one day, the heirs of the first voyagers would rise above their fracturing past and forge a true homeland in this new world.\n\nNow that day has come. With our people united and our rivals humbled, the ancient name spoken by the first colonists—Elysium—can finally be claimed. The sacred texts speak of Elysium as a land where heroes dwell in peace, a realm beyond memory and loss. Here, on the shores of our adopted world, we shall make that myth real.\n\nOur new capital shall be moved to the Elyric settlement of Dryopeia, standing as a bridge between the lands of the Elysilatinī to the north and the Elysinói to the south, the meeting point of all who call themselves Elysian."

 elysium.1.a: "Let this land be called Elysium."
