 northern_trade.1.title: "The Northern Trade"
 northern_trade.1.desc: "The Northern Trade is the humorous nickname for the rare days where old-world vessels find themselves on Vinland's shores. Typically an overzealous explorer or ships blown off course, rarely does a crew have the skill, supply, or dumb luck required to survive the voyage. As a result, these vessels are often no more than floating graveyards, warning us against looking back across the sea. But, rarely, these ships carry something or someone of great importance to our fledgling nation."
 northern_trade.1.a: "You'd think they'd stop looking for us!"

 northern_trade.2.title: "The Derelict"
 northern_trade.2.desc: "A few fisherman spotted a derelict ship floating just off the coast of Belle Isle. After boarding the ship, they found all but one member of the crew had died. We took in the survivor, who perished while raving about the end of days and divine punishments."
 northern_trade.2.a: "I'm sure that's nothing to worry about."

 northern_trade.2a.title: "Northern Refugees"

 northern_trade.3.title: "The General"
 northern_trade.3.desc: "For the first time in a century, an old-world vessel landed on our shores with crew still intact.

After a night of partying and drinking, we have decided to bring him into our court."
