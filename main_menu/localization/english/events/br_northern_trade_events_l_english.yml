 northern_trade.1.title: "The Northern Trade"
 northern_trade.1.desc: "The Northern Trade is the humorous nickname for the rare days where old-world vessels find themselves on Vinland's shores. Typically an overzealous explorer or ships blown off course, rarely does a crew have the skill, supply, or dumb luck required to survive the voyage. As a result, these vessels are often no more than floating graveyards, warning us against looking back across the sea. But, rarely, these ships carry something or someone of great importance to our fledgling nation."
