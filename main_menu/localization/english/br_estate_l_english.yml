  akritai_privilege: "Akritai Privilege"
  akritai_privilege_desc: "A traditional grant of authority and autonomy to the frontier nobility, modeled on the old Akritai who guarded the borders of the Rōmaíōn. These warriors are permitted to conduct sanctioned raids across hostile frontiers, seizing captives and disrupting enemy lands. While strengthening our border defenses, such privileges also empower the nobility and make centralization more difficult over time."
