 akritai_privilege: "Akritai Privilege"
 akritai_privilege_desc: "A traditional grant of authority and autonomy to the frontier nobility, modeled on the old Akritai who guarded the borders of the Rōmaíōn. These warriors are permitted to conduct sanctioned raids across hostile frontiers, seizing captives and disrupting enemy lands. While strengthening our border defenses, such privileges also empower the nobility and make centralization more difficult over time."

 boyarski_voiski: "Boiárski Voĭski"
 boyarski_voiski_desc: "The traditional levy of the Bulgarian boyars forms the backbone of our armies. These noble households maintain armed retainers and provide large contingents of horsemen in times of war. By reaffirming their martial rights and obligations, we strengthen our military capacity—though at the cost of granting the boyars greater influence within the realm."

 br_special_trade_companies: "Chartered Trade Companies"
 br_special_trade_companies_desc: "By granting expansive privileges to powerful trade companies, the state entrusts overseas commerce and naval logistics to mercantile elites.
