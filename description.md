[h1]Basileía Romaíon: 1337[/h1]
[code]The term "Basileia Romaion" (Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων) is the Greek name for the Eastern Roman Empire or "Byzantine" Empire. It was the official name of the empire in Greek during its existence. "Basileia" means "Empire" or "Kingdom," and "Romaion" means "of the Romans" or "Roman." This name reflects the "Byzantines" identification as Romans and their continuity with the Roman Empire.[/code]

BR: 1337 – World Lore Summary (Prequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2880120246]Basileía Romaíon 1736[/url])
[code][b]
The year is 1337. The course of history has broken wide open—empires tremble, kingdoms evolve, and familiar powers take on unfamiliar destinies. This is the dawn of the Basileía Romaíon universe.

The Medieval Roman Empire, though far from the thunderous heights of Basil II, has endured the Seljuk storm. Since the age of the Macedonians, relentless civil wars have torn at its foundations, causing the state to bend, fracture, and bleed. Many strategoi, douxes, and provincial dynatoi now offer only nominal loyalty to the Basileus in Konstantinoupolis.

The Seljuks, however, never entrenched themselves in Anatolia. Their descendants instead dominate Persia and Mesopotamia, where a shifting mosaic of Turkic dynasties battles for the coveted title of Khagan-i Oghuzistan. Meso-Persia remains a battleground of tribes, emirs, and ambitious warlords—each claiming the mantle of the Great Seljuks.

These lands escaped the worst of the Great Mongol Hordes through a mixture of shrewd diplomacy and timely submission, a fortune not shared by China, Central Asia, or Eastern Europe.

To the south, the Fatimid Caliphate endures in Egypt and the Levant. Ruling as a perennial Shia minority over a diverse and often uneasy population, the dynasty has proven remarkably resilient, balancing power between Arab notables, Berber factions, and Christian communities tied to ancient Coptic traditions.

In the heart of Europe, the Holy Roman Empire exists more in name than substance. The descendants of Charlemagne still wear the imperial crown, but their authority is largely ceremonial—fractured princelings and ambitious bishoprics truly rule the so-called Western Roman Lands.

Across the northern seas, history diverged dramatically in 1066. Harald Hardrada’s victories at Stamford Bridge and Niså forged a long-lasting union of Norway, Denmark, and most of England into the North Sea Empire. By 1337 it has become a decentralized realm of competing jarls, kinglets, and Thing-assemblies.

On the Iberian Peninsula, Al-Andalus remains whole under the Umayyads. The state maintains a broad, pragmatic tolerance toward its Christian subjects, and its cities rival Italy in learning, science, and trade. With no crusading devastation to break it apart, Andalusi culture continues to flourish.

Far across the Atlantic, the New World is not empty of Europeans. Small Vinlandic colonies—the remnants of Norse exploration—cling to life on windswept coasts, surviving through trade, intermarriage, and sheer stubbornness. Their isolation from the Old World has allowed unique dialects, customs, and beliefs to take shape.

And further south still, rumors circulate among the Norse of a forgotten people: descendants of late Western Roman refugees who fled westward across the ocean as the old empire collapsed. Cut off from Europe for nearly a millennium, they forged a civilization they call Elysium—half myth, half memory.
These Elysians are divided between Latin-speaking pantheonic worshipers in the north and Greek-speaking Christians in the south, each claiming to be the truest heirs of the Roman ideal.

The Old World stands on the edge of crisis and transformation. The New World hides legacies long severed from Rome.
