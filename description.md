BR: 1337 – World Lore Overview (Prequel to Basileía Romaíon 1736)

The year is 1337, and the world stands at a crossroads. This is the early foundation of the Basileía Romaíon 1736 universe—scaled backward into a medieval setting where familiar powers endure, fracture, or transform along alternate lines.

The Medieval Roman Empire, though far from the thunderous heights reached under Basil II, has weathered the Seljuk storm. The Seljuks themselves never entrenched in Anatolia; instead, their descendants dominate Persia and Mesopotamia, where a patchwork of Turkic dynasties now struggle for the vaunted title of Khagan-i Oghuzistan. Asia remains a battlefield of tribes, emirs, and would-be conquerors, each claiming the legacy of the Great Seljuks.

To the south, the Fatimid Caliphate endures in Egypt and the Levant. Though ruling as a perennial Shia minority over a diverse and often uneasy population, the dynasty has proven remarkably resilient, balancing power between Arab notables, Berber factions, and Christian communities tied to ancient Coptic traditions.

In the heart of Europe, the Holy Roman Empire exists more in name than substance. The descendants of Charlemagne still wear the imperial crown, but their authority is little more than ceremonial—fractured princelings and ambitious bishoprics truly rule the "Western Roman Lands".

Across the northern seas, history diverged dramatically in 1066. Harald Hardrada’s victory at Stamford Bridge forged a long-lasting union of Norway, Denmark, and most of England into the North Sea Empire. By 1337 it is a decentralized realm of competing jarls, kinglets, and Thing-assemblies.

On the Iberian Peninsula, Al-Andalus remains whole under the Umayyads. The state has embraced a broad, pragmatic tolerance toward its Christian subjects, and its culture rivals Italy in learning, science, and trade. With no crusading devastation to break it apart, Andalusi cities continue to flourish.

Far across the Atlantic, the New World is not empty of europeans. Small Vinlandic colonies—the remnants of Norse exploration—cling to life on windswept coasts, surviving through trade, intermarriage, and sheer stubbornness. Their isolation from the Old World has allowed unique dialects, customs, and beliefs to take shape.

And deeper still to the south, rumors spread among the Norse of a forgotten people: descendants of late Western Roman refugees who fled across the western ocean as the old empire collapsed. Cut off from Europe for nearly a millennium, they forged a civilization they call Elysium—half myth, half memory.
These Elysians are divided between Latin-speaking pantheonic worshipers in the north and Greek-speaking Christians in the south, each claiming to be the true heirs of the Roman ideal.

The Old World stands on the edge of crisis and transformation. The New World hides legacies long severed from Rome. And from these threads, the world of Basileía Romaíon 1736 will one day emerge.
